_________________________________
deBug               - debug level
PROFILER_LOCATION   - Location of profiler
LOOP_STARTUP_TIME   - Minutes before cast to start cast procedure
SYNC_TIME(0)        - Cast time in minutes past hour.
SYNC_TIME(1)        - same
SYNC_TIME(2)        - same
SYNC_TIME(3)        - same
SYNC_TIME(4)        - same
SYNC_TIME(5)        - same
HOME_POSITION       - Number of clicks down from the absolute top to home
                      position.
CLICKS_PER_M        - Optical encoder starte changes per meter of instrument
                      travel.
DELTA_CLICKS        - Click Frequency to check depth change for errors
HOME_TO_WL_COUNT    - Clicks down home position to waterline position
WL_TO_HOME_COUNT    - Clicks up from waterline position to home position
AMPS_LOW            - Low current to use at end of home when sonde is out of
                      water. FLOAT
AMPS_NORMAL         - Standard current threshold. FLOAT
AMPS_BOOSTED        - Higher current threshold when boosted. FLOAT
PTC_CURRENT_MIN     - Maximum current the PTC will draw when tripped. FLOAT
PTC_CURRENT_MAX     - Minimum current the PTC will draw when tripped. FLOAT
LOW_VOLTAGE         - Low voltage_load alarm level. FLOAT
DEPTH_PORT          - Depth instrument port
DEPTH_BAUD          - Depth instrument baud rate
DEPTH_MARGIN_M      - Distance to stop sonde before reaching depth value. FLOAT
water_depth_m       - water depth to use until instrument returns new value. FLOAT
MIN_DEPTH_M         - Minimum water depth. Used to reject spuriously shallow
                      readings. FLOAT
max_depth_m         - Maximum water depth in m, used to reject spuriously deep
                      readings. FLOAT
MAX_CAST_DEPTH_M    - This is the maximum depth the platform can cast to before
                      the line starts backspooling. It will depend mostly on
                      cable length. FLOAT
SALTWATER_COND      - Threshold for deciding if sonde is in the water.
                      Dependent on overall water salinity. FLOAT
SMS_ADDRESS         - Address to which critical alarm messages are sent 
LAUNCH_CHECK_CLICKS - Number of clicks into cast where depth & conductivity 
                      should be checked to see if we should abort.
ENCODER_MAX_TIME    - Maximum time beween clicks without generating an error
AVP_SENSOR_CONFIG   - Index to various sensor setups.
                      1 = 6600v1 without pH, ClarkCell DO, and NMEA depth
                      2 = 6600v2 with pH and ODO, and SeaTalk depth
                      3+ future use.
ISCO_ENABLED        - Use isch_sch.txt schedule if it exists.
ISCO_SLEEP_TIME     - Time to sleep in seconds while ISCO samples
AVP_LIMIT_RELAY     - Set to 1 if the platform has a sensor and relay to
                      prevent the motor from pulling up the sonde too far. 
SONDE_FILTERING     - If set to T, the sonde's filtering capabilities will be enabled.
PROFILER_NUMBER     - Platform number. Stored to EEPROM
